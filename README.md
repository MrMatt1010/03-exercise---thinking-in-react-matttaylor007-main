# 03 Exercise - Thinking in React

## Brief

Your team is about to start working on a Todo application. Your Tech Lead has asked you to create wireframes and break the user interface (UI) into a component hierarchy.

## Instructions

### Wireframes

To improve the user experience design [wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/). When designing the wireframes, keep in mind your users' needs. The user should be able to:

- add tasks to keep track of todos
- view their existing tasks
- edit tasks when the task description is not accurate
- delete tasks to remove todos they do not need to do anymore
- indicate which tasks are done to keep track of tasks which are already done

Use a tool of your choice:

- pen and paper
- [MockFlow](https://www.mockflow.com/)
- [Miro](https://miro.com/templates/low-fidelity-wireframes/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/809483562248762502)
- or something else

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Wireframes are created. Screenshots or images of the wireframes are added to the [wireframes folder](./wireframes/wireframes.md).

### Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

To plan the implementation of the user experience, use the wireframes you created and draw boxes around every component in the wireframes and give them all names. (See [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).)

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Screenshots of the updated wireframes are added to the [wireframes folder](./wireframes/wireframes.md).

### Submit the exercise
